This post is consists of a tutorial about deep learning using Julia languange

In general, deep learning tackles the problem of self-learning and predicting the future action. It enables the computer to be able to learn by self. By doing that, the computer can predict something depends of the problem set.

It consists of

1. Logistic Regression

2. Artificial Neural Network

3. Convolutional Neural Network

4. Recurrent Neural Network

5. Auto-Encoder
